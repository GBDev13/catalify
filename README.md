A virtual catalog with a range of useful features that I developed primarily for learning purposes. However, I decided to take it a step further and test how the project would perform with a paid subscription model. This decision led me to spend more time refining the project until I reached a point where I was satisfied with its level of completion.

Although the project was developed in Portuguese, I aimed it toward Brazilian customers, given that digital catalogs are extremely popular in Brazil.

I hope you find Catalify as exciting and helpful as I do. Please feel free to share your thoughts and feedbacks.
